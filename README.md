# Linear Algebra for Machine Learning

A collection of Jupyter notebooks for learning linear algebra concepts essential for machine learning.

## 📚 Contents

### Week 1
- **C1_W1_Lab_1_introduction_to_numpy_arrays.ipynb** - Introduction to NumPy arrays and basic operations
- **C1_W1_Lab_2_linear_systems_as_matrices.ipynb** - Understanding linear systems and matrix representations

### Week 2-3
- **C1W2_Assignment.ipynb** - Week 2 assignment covering vector operations and linear transformations
- **C1W3_UGL_1_vector_operations.ipynb** - Vector operations and geometric linear algebra

### Additional Resources
- **trymatplotwithsystem.ipynb** - Visualization and experimentation notebook
- **utils.py** - Utility functions for plotting linear systems

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib jupyter
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## 📖 Topics Covered

- NumPy array creation and manipulation
- Matrix operations and linear systems
- Vector operations and norms
- Linear transformations
- Solving systems of linear equations
- Visualization of 2D linear systems

## 📝 How to Use

1. Open any notebook in Jupyter
2. Run cells sequentially to learn concepts
3. Modify code examples and experiment
4. Complete assignments to practice

## 🛠️ Utilities

The `utils.py` file contains helper functions:
- `plot_lines()` - Visualizes 2D linear systems by plotting equations and their solutions

## 📊 Example Output

The visualization utilities help you understand:
- How linear equations appear graphically
- Intersection points (solutions) of linear systems
- Visual representation of 2D solution spaces

## 💡 Learning Path

1. Start with Week 1 labs for NumPy fundamentals
2. Progress to linear systems and matrices
